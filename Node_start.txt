Introduction
************
    - NodeJS is the Server run time envriounment.

    - NodeJS, used to implete the Servers.

            Http Server

            TCP Server

    - we will implement Node Applications in two ways.

        1) JavaScript

        2) TypeScript
    
    - JavaScript is the Scripting Language and won't supports OOPS.

    - TypeScript is the Programming Language and supports OOPS.

    - we will implement the servers by using either "predefined" or "3rd" party libraries


1) http

    - http library used to develop the http servers.


2) fs

    - fs stands for file system

    - fs module, used to interact with the "flat files".

    Ex
        XML files

        JSON files

        Text Files


3) express

    - express is the "framework".

    - express framework used to develop the restful services.

    Ex.
        GET
        POST
        PUT
        DELETE
        PATCH


4) mysql

    - used to interact with the mysql database.


5) mssql

    - used to connect to SQLServer.


6) mongodb & mongoose

    - either mongodb or mongoose used to connect to mongodb database.

    - mongodb module will connect to mongodb database without "schema"

    - mongoose module will connect to mongodb database with "Schema".

    - Schema means rules and regulations.


6) cors

    - used to enable the CORS Policy.

    - enabling communication between different ports called as cors policy.


7) body-parser

    - used to receive the data from client application


8) jwt-simple / jsonwebtoken

    - used to generate the tokens.

    - in general, we will use these tokens for authentication purpose.

    - this authentication called as token based authentication.


9) multer

    - used to upload the images to the server.


10) socket.io

    - used to implement the chat applications


11) nodemailer

    - it is used to send the email from node server

12) encryptjs

    - used to encrypt/decrypt the passwords.


Note : all the above libraries downloads to "node_modules" directory in current path


Software Installations
**********************

1) download and install NodeJS

website : https://nodejs.org/en/

file    : node-v16.6.1-x64.msi


2) install yarn tool

    > npm install -g yarn

    "-g" stands for global Installation


3) install nodemon tool

    - it is used to start the node server in watch mode.

    - this tool, watches the file changes continuosly.

    > npm install -g nodemon


4) install Visual Studio Code

    website : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win

    file    : VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.59.0.exe


5) install Postman

    - used to test the rest api calls



start the node server
*********************
Ex.
    app.js


> node app.js

> nodemon app.js


1) ExpressJS

2) CRUD 

3) authentication & secuirity

4) exceptional handling


                                ***** ExpressJS *****

    - ExpressJS is framework.

    - ExpressJS used to develop the rest api's.

            Ex.
                    GET
                    POST
                    PUT

                    PATCH
                    
    - express is the 3rd party framework.

    - we will download express library by using either "npm" or "yarn" tool

    - "express" framework downloads to "node_modules" folder in current path.
